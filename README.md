# Tumor_Heterogeneity

This repository contains the R scripts calculating the tumor heterogeneity and applying patients' clustering introduced in paper “Evolutionary states and trajectories characterized by distinct pathways stratify ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma patients”.

The "cellular_freqs.R" calculates the intra and inter-tumor heterogeneity using clonal frequencies as input.
